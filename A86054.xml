            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>THe Arme of the Lord daily brings mighty things to paÅ¿Å¿e: But there are Å¿ome things which he brings to paÅ¿Å¿e in Å¿uch a manner, that therein He makes His Arme bare and naked: He Å¿hewes his power and migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty working, with Å¿uch evidence and demonÅ¿tration that it Å¿trikes and Å¿hines like lightning, even into cloÅ¿ed eyes, and extorts an acknowledgement, That this is the power, and the very Arme of the Lord: thus is it when effects ariÅ¿e in a notable eminence, far above naturall cauÅ¿es, or contrary to them: When weakneÅ¿Å¿e performes the worke of extraordinary Å¿trength; and when notable Å¿trength, even Å¿trength unto preÅ¿umption, is turned into extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary weakneÅ¿Å¿e: When the bowes of the mighty are bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and they that Å¿tumbled, are girt with Å¿trength.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>In this manner hath the Lords Arme of late appeared viÅ¿ibly in Å¿undry places; But moÅ¿t eminently in the WeÅ¿t, where with his own right Arme, he hath gotten HimÅ¿elf the Victory, and bestowed it upon us. The Towns of</hi> Weymouth <hi>and</hi> Melcomb <hi>are near by Å¿cituation, and one of them being dead, threatned death to the other; yea, the Enemy spake like the Egyptians of old (as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in intercepted Letters) I will purÅ¿ue, I will over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:123234:3"/>I will divide the spoile, my lust Å¿hall be Å¿atisfied upon them: But thy right hand, O Lord, is become glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, thy right hand hath daÅ¿hed the enemy in pieces; The living Town is kept alive, and by it God wrought a ReÅ¿urrection in that which was dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to proceed according to the order of time, as firÅ¿t in that order (among Gods late gracious diÅ¿penÅ¿ations of Victory to the Parliaments forces) is preÅ¿ented to our view, and thankfulneÅ¿Å¿e.</p>

                     <p>IT hath pleaÅ¿ed God to give us happy Å¿ucceÅ¿Å¿e in the taking of the Town and Harbour of <hi>Scarborough,</hi> which otherwiÅ¿e might have proved a receptacle for Strangers, and a Å¿ubject for the lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger continuance of this war; beÅ¿ides the inconveniences to the City of <hi>London,</hi> and other Southern parts by the interruption of the Coale Trade.</p>
                     <p>The Service was done after this manner: After that, their three men of war, which were appointed to Å¿coure along the Sands, were beaten and Å¿unke, and their Ordinance made unÅ¿erviceable: A Summons being Å¿ent, and an AnÅ¿wer returned, preÅ¿ent order was given, for falling upon their Works and the Town; which was done without any reÅ¿iÅ¿tance, untill they drew their Body within a Å¿trong Work about the Church, which if they had maintained as they might have done, they had puÅ¿led us; but upon view of the advancing of our foot, to cut their paÅ¿Å¿age betwixt the CaÅ¿tle, and the Church, they all retired within the CaÅ¿tle in great diÅ¿order: There was a Å¿trife betwixt the Officers and Souldiers, who Å¿hould Å¿hew moÅ¿t forwardneÅ¿Å¿e. Sir <hi>Hugh Cholmley</hi> did expect reliefe within four dayes.</p>

                     <p>ON the eighteenth of February laÅ¿t, the Enemy having the night before made a worke upon the old worke at Mont-Stamford, with a very large Line both Å¿ides from the worke; the Sea-men in the morning fell on them, and tooke one halfe Moon, which was made at the Å¿outh end of the Line; but the enemies horÅ¿e comming upon them, forced them to retreat, but with no loÅ¿Å¿e on our Å¿ide, bleÅ¿Å¿ed be God; Upon which we were all commanded to Armes; Å¿everall Companies were drawn out to goe over, and two Troops of horÅ¿e; one being Å¿till quartered on that Å¿ide, to joyne with Å¿ome Sea-men taken on Å¿hore for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poÅ¿e, all (I thinke) conÅ¿iÅ¿ting of about five hundred, and all the reÅ¿t of the GarriÅ¿on were commanded to march out to face the enemy on the North-Å¿ide, and were drawne without our Line within Musket-Å¿hot of their worke under the Hill, the Hill be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friending us, that they could not play much on us: All we did, was only Å¿ending out Å¿mall Parties to Å¿hoot, as if we intended to fall on, that Å¿o they might draw off Å¿ome of their forces from the other Å¿ide of the water, where our purpoÅ¿e was to fall on: and it Å¿eemes, they did draw off Å¿ome horÅ¿e; and about two of the Clock in the after-noone, our men fell upon Mont-Stamford, where the enemy powred out mighty vollies of Å¿hot, as I have Å¿eene or heard; but our men went on with that reÅ¿olution both horÅ¿e and foot, that within little more then halfe an houre we tooke the worke, routed the enemy both horÅ¿e and foot, purÅ¿u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them above a mile, hewing and cutting them.

I thinke it my duty to give you an account of Gods miraculous diÅ¿penÅ¿ations towards us. All (as you have formerly received) beeing treacheronÅ¿ly deliver into the hand of the enemy except <hi>Melcombe.</hi> On tueÅ¿day laÅ¿t <hi>Feb.</hi> 25. the enemy having drawne out many of their foot to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a party of their horÅ¿e, being indanger to be ingaged
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:123234:8"/>by a party of ours which I Å¿ent out to diÅ¿cover the enemy. I fell preÅ¿ently upon <hi>Weymouth,</hi> which Towne (together with the Chappell Fort) was in an houre regained; where wee tooke priÅ¿oners, one Lievtenant Collonel one Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor, three Captains, and one hundred of inferior Officers and Common Souldiers, which Å¿o inraged the enemy that upon thurÅ¿day laÅ¿t about Midnight they furiouÅ¿ly Å¿tormed us at Å¿everall places of both Townes, out of all <hi>Weymouth</hi> we were not able to keep them, and therefore reÅ¿olved to make good Å¿o much of it as might let us, upon any occaÅ¿ion, too and from the Chappell Fort. The enemy came in great multitudes thorow the Streets and backe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ides at both ends of the Towne, and diÅ¿puted with us very hotly about three houres for that Å¿male part of it, which wee were willing to keepe. The Chappell Fort, and <hi>Melcombe</hi> beeing likewiÅ¿e Å¿tormed at the Å¿ame time from all which places God inabled us to repell them. In all this time they wounded but one of my men. What exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution was done upon the enemy, I am not certaine they carrying off as many as they were able before day, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongÅ¿t whom (as the people of the Towne have Å¿ince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me) were divers in Buffe-Coats, and Velvet-lack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets they left much blood behind them in the Streets and Å¿laine men upon the place, they carryed (as it is reported) many wounded men into one Village a mile from the Towne. Upon Friday about 10 of the Clocke, they Å¿udden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly left (except plunder) all which they had formerly gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, quitted their Forts, and marched away in a body, lying now at a little diÅ¿tance but blocking us up Å¿till as before, what they meane to doe next I know not, but doe expect Å¿ome further deÅ¿igne upon us, for they are now Å¿ummoning in the Country at DorcheÅ¿ter from Å¿ixteene to Å¿ixty.</p>

                     <p>AFter many great raines which have fallen in theÅ¿e parts (which was no invitation for a Souldier to lye in the nelds) yet Å¿uch was the gallantry of Major Generall <hi>Laugherne</hi> to promote the CauÅ¿e in hand, that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie no Å¿ooner crowned his deÅ¿ires with a happy Å¿eaÅ¿on, but in a gracefull acknowledgement, hee placed a GarriÅ¿on in <hi>Laugherne</hi> CaÅ¿tle, and from thence marched towards <hi>Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan,</hi> with about five hundred HorÅ¿e, and three hundred Foot; and on the 21 of <hi>December,</hi> 1644. hee Å¿ate downe before <hi>Cardigan</hi> CaÅ¿tle, demanding a Å¿urrender thereof for the Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the King and Parliament: But Major <hi>Slaughter</hi> who commanded in chiefe, replyed, he held that CaÅ¿tle for the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:123234:11"/>Å¿ervice of the King, and Å¿o long as he had life he would keepe it for his MajeÅ¿ty, (though therein he was not a man of his word.) After three dayes Å¿iege, the Major Generall perceiving all further attempts would be in vaine, unleÅ¿Å¿e a breach could be forced, and having no artillery with him he forthwith gave order the Demy-Culverin Å¿hould be brought from <hi>Laugherne,</hi> which with much difficulty and induÅ¿try came Å¿afe to <hi>Cardigan,</hi> and being placed to the beÅ¿t advantage he fell to battery.</p>
                     <p>The enemy within the CaÅ¿tle-yard caÅ¿t up a halfe moone Å¿ome diÅ¿tance from the place on which the Demy-Culve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rin played, in which they placed their great gunnes laden with CaÅ¿e-Shot, that in caÅ¿e a breach Å¿hould be made thoÅ¿e guns might diÅ¿animate our men in entering, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme Å¿uddaine execution on them: Our men plying the Demy-Culverin forced a breach, and being full of reÅ¿olu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion entred, running in the mouth of their guns, recovered the halfe moone, where the enemy, as men bereft of all Å¿enÅ¿e, having not the power to give fire to their guns, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the LinÅ¿tocks were in their hands ready lighted, caÅ¿t downe all their armes, and cryed for quarter, the which was granted: from thence we entred the CaÅ¿tle and tooke PriÅ¿oner Major <hi>Slaughter</hi> and his wife, one Captain <hi>Vaughan</hi> with their Lievtenant and EnÅ¿igne, one Doctor <hi>Taylor</hi> a Divine with about an hundred Common Souldiers, Å¿ix great guns, a hundred and fifty armes, a quantity of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, ball, and other proviÅ¿ions, and this was done the 29. of <hi>December</hi> laÅ¿t.

Seamen were Å¿ent, who after a view had of the place, undertooke it, which was performed on this wiÅ¿e: A boate laden with proviÅ¿ions was placed in the middle between foure boats on each Å¿ide, two of which were manned with Seamen, who in flankes faced both wayes, plying their Musketts on the enemy, who from the Å¿hore played on them with about 300. Musketiers, yet our Seamen gallantly proceeded, put all the proviÅ¿ions into the CaÅ¿tle, and returned without the loÅ¿Å¿e of one man onely two Å¿lightly wounded. After this Collonel <hi>Laug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herne</hi> having drawn his foot into a body, being without Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in all about 350 he encouraged them to give an aÅ¿Å¿ult on the Towne, which after Å¿ome debate was attempted, and on the 22. of <hi>January</hi> laÅ¿t our foote forced their paÅ¿Å¿age over the Bridge, in which we loÅ¿t but one man and having beaten the Enemy from their firÅ¿t guard, they preÅ¿Å¿ed on to the Å¿econd, which they alÅ¿o tooke, and purÅ¿uing the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory beate them out of their maine guard, which was at the market place, and then out of the Church, where our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces tooke two braÅ¿Å¿e Demy-Culverins, which <hi>Gerrard</hi> brought from <hi>BriÅ¿toll,</hi> with Å¿ome Powder, Ball, and all their proviÅ¿ions, and following the enemy beat them all out of the Towne, and Å¿o we are now MaÅ¿ters both of the Towne and CaÅ¿tle. Of the enemy were Å¿laine in the place, 85. beÅ¿ides thoÅ¿e that were Å¿laine before the CaÅ¿tle, 100. priÅ¿oners were taken, and their whole Forces routed,
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:123234:12"/>and I believe in their flight they never looked behind them, untill they came to CaÅ¿tle <hi>Emlyne,</hi> which is Å¿ix miles from <hi>Cardigan:</hi> In the Town we alÅ¿o took 250. armes I have not heard Å¿ince theÅ¿e unhappy differences begun in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, that the hand of the Almighty hath more viÅ¿ibly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in giving Å¿o great victories to Å¿o Å¿mall a handfull then hath been manifeÅ¿ted in theÅ¿e parts, and to his own power we attribute all the praiÅ¿e and glory.</p>

               <head>The ConcluÅ¿ion.</head>
               <p>ANd now Å¿ince the Arme and Power of God hath Å¿o plainly appeared; and a fire is come downe from Heaven into the hearts of thoÅ¿e that fought for Gods CauÅ¿e, to inflame them with zeale and courage, by which fire alÅ¿o their AdverÅ¿aries have been conÅ¿umed; Let the people no longer halt between two opinions, but confeÅ¿Å¿e as in the dayes of <hi>Eliah,</hi> That the Lord is God, and let it be Å¿een, That God at laÅ¿t hath turned the heart of this people. Let them no longer fight againÅ¿t God; for who ever fought againÅ¿t him and proÅ¿pered? HowÅ¿oever let Gods own peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, behold and magnifie the worke of God, and let their hearts be lifted up in dependance upon him, and in the maintenance of that CauÅ¿e which he Å¿o manifeÅ¿tly owneth. Who is wiÅ¿e, and he Å¿hall underÅ¿tand theÅ¿e things? Prudent, and he Å¿hall know them; for the wayes of the Lord are right, and the juÅ¿t Å¿hall walke in them, but the tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ors Å¿hall fall therein.</p>
